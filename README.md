# Cookie-Order
A simple ordering program that I made in Sophomore year of High School. It allows you to add boxes of cookies, and then remove them by flavor.
To run this program, click on the .bat file. The file is safe, you can edit it to see the command, it just runs the .jar program which has problems running on its own.
